      "content": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date:\n  - If the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n  - If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n  - If the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n## Book flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.\n\n- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\n- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refund\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n"

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is saying they added insurance but it's not showing up. Let me figure out how to help.\n\nFirst, I need to check if they can provide their reservation details. Since the insurance information is part of the reservation, I should get the reservation ID. Without that, I can't look up the details. \n\nWait, the user might not remember the reservation ID. Maybe I should ask them to provide it. Alternatively, if they can't, maybe I can check their user profile for reservations. But according to the tools, there's a function called get_reservation_details which requires the reservation_id. So I need that to proceed.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned they thought they added insurance. The insurance is part of the booking parameters. So when they booked, they might have selected insurance. But if it's not showing, maybe the booking wasn't processed correctly, or maybe the insurance was added later. However, the policy says that insurance can't be added after initial booking. So if they tried to add it later, that's not possible. \n\nWait, the user might have added it during booking, but the system didn't save it. So I need to check the reservation details. Let me ask for the reservation ID first. Once I have that, I can use get_reservation_details to check the insurance status. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to add insurance now, but according to the policy, they can't. So I should inform them that insurance can't be added after booking. But the user is saying it's not showing up, so maybe it was never added. \n\nSo steps: \n1. Ask for reservation ID to check details.\n2. If they provide it, use get_reservation_details to see if insurance is included.\n3. If not, check if they tried to add it after booking, which isn't allowed.\n4. If they need to add insurance, inform them it's not possible post-booking.\n\nBut the user might not know the reservation ID. Maybe I should ask them to check their email or provide other details to find the reservation. However, the tools don't have a function to search by user ID or other info, only get_reservation_details requires the ID. So I need the reservation ID. \n\nSo the first step is to ask the user for their reservation ID. Then proceed accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo check the insurance status of your reservation, I'll need the reservation ID. Could you please provide the reservation number associated with your flight? This will allow me to look up the details and confirm whether insurance was included in your booking.",

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to help the user. They mentioned they're sure they added insurance when booking, but the reservation details show \"insurance\": \"no\". Hmm, maybe there was an error in the system or perhaps the insurance wasn't processed correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a way to update the insurance status. Looking at the tools provided, there's the update_reservation_flights and update_reservation_baggages functions, but those are for flights and baggage. Wait, there's no specific tool for updating insurance. The user can't add insurance after booking, according to the policy. The policy says under Modify flight, \"The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\" So maybe the system doesn't allow changing insurance once the reservation is made.\n\nBut the user is insistent. Maybe they thought they added it, but the system didn't record it. Alternatively, maybe the insurance was added but not reflected in the reservation details. However, the get_reservation_details response clearly shows \"insurance\": \"no\". \n\nSince the policy states that insurance can't be added after booking, I should inform the user that it's not possible. But the user is a regular member without travel insurance, and they need it. The policy also mentions that if they complain about a cancellation or delay, a certificate might be offered, but only if they meet certain criteria. \n\nWait, the user is asking to add insurance now. Since the policy says they can't add it after initial booking, I need to check if there's any other function that can help. The available functions don't include adding insurance. The only related function is get_reservation_details, which shows insurance as \"no\". \n\nSo, the answer is that the insurance can't be added now. But the user might need to contact customer support. However, the policy says to transfer to a human agent only if the issue can't be resolved with tools. Since the system doesn't allow adding insurance post-booking, I should inform the user that it's not possible and suggest contacting support. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to rebook with insurance. But the user might not want to cancel. I need to check the tools again. The book_reservation function requires insurance as \"yes\" or \"no\". If the user wants to add insurance, maybe they need to rebook the entire reservation, but that's a big step. \n\nBut the user's reservation is already made. Since the policy doesn't allow adding insurance after booking, I should tell them that. Also, the system's response shows insurance as \"no\", so there's no way to change that. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that insurance can't be added and suggest contacting customer support for further assistance.\n</think>\n\nThe reservation details confirm that travel insurance was not selected during booking (PEP4E0). According to the policy, **insurance cannot be added after the initial booking**. This means the option is no longer available for this reservation. \n\nSince this is a critical issue, I will transfer you to a human agent to resolve this directly.",
