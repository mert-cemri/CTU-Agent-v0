      "content": "# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users cancel or modify pending orders, return or exchange delivered orders, modify their default user address, or provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products.\n\n- At the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\n- Once the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\n- You can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\n- Before taking consequential actions that update the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you have to list the action detail and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- You should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided from the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- You should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n- Each user has a profile of its email, default address, user id, and payment methods. Each payment method is either a gift card, a paypal account, or a credit card.\n\n- Our retail store has 50 types of products. For each type of product, there are variant items of different options. For example, for a 't shirt' product, there could be an item with option 'color blue size M', and another item with option 'color red size L'.\n\n- Each product has an unique product id, and each item has an unique item id. They have no relations and should not be confused.\n\n- Each order can be in status 'pending', 'processed', 'delivered', or 'cancelled'. Generally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\n- Exchange or modify order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\n- An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\n- An order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- For a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\n- The user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\n- If the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be kept 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\n- This action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)', and the agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So confirm all the details are right and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be modified.\n\n- For a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\n- An order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\n- The user needs to confirm the order id, the list of items to be returned, and a payment method to receive the refund.\n\n- The refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\n- An order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\n- For a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\n- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n"

They provided their name and zip code, so I should use the find_user_id_by_name_zip function. Let me check the parameters: first_name, last_name, and zip. The user gave \"Fatima Johnson\" and zip 78712. I'll split the name into first and last names. Fatima is the first name, Johnson the last. Then, call the function with those details. If successful, I'll get the user ID. Once authenticated, I can proceed to check their pending orders. But wait, the user mentioned \"all pending orders,\" so I need to list each one and confirm cancellation for each. However, the cancel_pending_order function requires an order ID and reason. Since the user hasn't provided specific order IDs yet, I need to first retrieve their orders using get_order_details, but I need the user ID for that. So the next step is to find the user ID via the name and zip. Let me make sure the function call is correct. If the user isn't found, I'll have to ask for more details. Once the user ID is confirmed, I can then get their order details to list the pending orders. Then, for each order, prompt the user to confirm cancellation. But the user wants to cancel all at once. Wait, the function requires individual order IDs. So maybe I need to list each pending order and get confirmation for each. Alternatively, if the user wants to cancel all, I need to check each order's status and process them one by one. But the initial step is authentication.

But now there's an error saying \"non-delivered order cannot be returned.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. The order status was delivered, so why the error?\n\nHmm, maybe there was a mistake in the order details. Let me check the order status again. The user's last interaction showed the order as delivered, but the system is now saying it's not delivered. Or perhaps the order was updated after the user's last check. \n\nWait, the user initially wanted to return the watch from order #W9389413. The first attempt used a gift card, which had insufficient balance. Then the user switched to PayPal, but the system returned an error about the order not being delivered. But earlier, the order was confirmed as delivered. \n\nWait, maybe the order status changed after the user's last check. Let me verify the order details again. The user's last tool call was get_order_details for #W9389413, which showed status \"delivered\". But when trying to return, the system says it's non-delivered. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the error is a system glitch. Or maybe the order was actually processed and marked as delivered, but the system is having an inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to return an item that's already been processed. \n\nWait, the user is trying to return the Smart Watch (item ID 2554056026) from a delivered order. The error message says \"non-delivered order cannot be returned,\" which contradicts the previous status. This might be a system error, but I need to handle it. \n\nSince the user is trying to return an item from a delivered order, but the system says it's not delivered, I should check the order status again. However, the user has already confirmed the order is delivered. Maybe the system is outdated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order was marked as delivered, but the return process requires the order to be in a specific state. Let me check the domain rules. \n\nAccording to the domain basic, return_delivered_order_items can only be called on delivered orders. The user's order was confirmed as delivered, so the error might be a system issue. But since the tool call is failing, perhaps the order status is actually not delivered. \n\nWait, maybe the order was processed and delivered, but the system hasn't updated the status. Or maybe the user is trying to return an item that's already been fulfilled. \n\nIn any case, the user is trying to return an item from a delivered order, but the system is rejecting it. The correct approach is to inform the user of the error and suggest checking the order status again. Alternatively, if the order is indeed delivered, there might be a system issue, and the user should be directed to contact support. \n\nBut according to the tools, the return_delivered_order_items function requires the order to be delivered. Since the user's last check showed delivered, but the tool call is failing, perhaps the system is inconsistent. \n\nI should respond by confirming the order status and asking the user to verify, or suggest contacting support if the order is indeed delivered. Alternatively, if the order is not delivered, explain that returns can't be processed yet. \n\nBut the user is confident the order is delivered. So the error might be a system glitch. In that case, the user should be advised to try again or contact support. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order was marked as delivered, but the return process requires the order to be in a different state. For example, maybe the order needs to be in \"delivered\" but not yet processed. \n\nIn any case, the correct response is to inform the user of the error and guide them accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe system indicates that order **#W9389413** is not in a deliverable state for returns, despite earlier confirmation of delivery. This inconsistency might be due to a system update or error. \n\nTo resolve this:\n1. **Verify the order status** again via the \"Get Order Details\" tool.\n2. If confirmed delivered, the issue may require manual intervention. \n3. Alternatively, if the order is not yet delivered, returns cannot proceed until delivery is confirmed.\n\nWould you like me to recheck the order status for you?",
