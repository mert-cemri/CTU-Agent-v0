I'm currently facing issues accessing the restaurant details. Let's proceed by searching for R245 within the 94103 area to see if it's one of the options we found earlier. If it doesn't appear, I can suggest other nearby Mexican restaurants with a $10-$20 price range. Would you like to proceed with the search for R245 or try another option?<|im_end|>

Thank you, Robert Johnson will be on our list. Once the search is complete, I will provide you with any available information about him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Sure, I'll fetch the details of Robert Johnson first. While we wait, if you could provide me with more context about his medical needs or any symptoms he might be experiencing, it would be helpful in assessing the urgency of an appointment. Once we have the information, I will proceed with scheduling accordingly.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Understood. I will proceed with fetching the medical information for Robert Johnson. Once we have that, we can evaluate the urgency and discuss the scheduling of an appointment. Please provide me with any additional details about his health status so we can make an informed decision.

While we wait, could you please confirm if Robert Johnson has any pre-existing medical conditions or if he is currently under any health management? This information will be crucial in our assessment.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Absolutely, let's wait for the information to come in first. Once we have it, I will reach out to you with the details so we can discuss the urgency of his medical needs and plan accordingly.

Please hold on, and I will initiate the search again to retrieve the information for Robert Johnson. If you could provide any additional details you might have later, it would be helpful in making the best decision.

I will start the search now.
{"tool_calls": [{"function": {"name": "search_patients", "arguments": {"name": "Robert Johnson", "phone": null, "email": null}}}]}

Please note that if the search is unsuccessful, we might need to gather more information from Robert Johnson or use other identifiers like his social security number or a recent visit record to find him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Of course, I'll initiate the search again. Please provide your contact information so we can communicate the results.

If you have any immediate concerns or need to provide additional details while the search is underway, feel free to share them. I'll keep you updated as soon as the search results are available.

Let's start with the search now.
{"tool_calls": [{"function": {"name": "search_patients", "arguments": {"name": "Robert Johnson", "phone": null, "email": null}}}]}
