The return notification I received is not updating or showing any progress. It's been several days.

This usually happens within 1-3 business days.\n\n2. **Technical Issues**: There could be temporary technical issues in the system, causing delays in updating the order status.\n\n3. **Processing Time**: If the return has already been processed, there may be a delay in updating the user's account or the order status.\n\n4. **Communication Issues**: There might be a discrepancy between what was communicated in the notification and what is showing in the system.\n\nTo resolve this, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Check the Order Status**: Make sure the order status shows \"return requested\" and not \"canceled\" or \"completed.\" \n\n2. **Notify Customer Support**: If you still see no updates or if there's a discrepancy, contacting customer support directly might help resolve the issue quickly.\n\n3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Sometimes, notifications take time to update, so give it a few more days.\n\nIf you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

However, if you're still seeing no updates, here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Order Status**: Double-check that the order status shows \"return requested.\" If it shows a different status, there might be an issue with the order or item.\n\n2. **System Delays**: There might be temporary technical issues with the system. These are usually resolved within 1-2 business days, but sometimes it takes longer.\n\n3. **Account Update**: It's possible that there's a slight delay in updating your account information in the system.\n\n4. **Customer Support**: If the above doesn't help, contacting customer support directly might be necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to update your account information directly.

Task<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand you'd like to return the Fleece Jacket, Vacuum Cleaner, and Dumbbell Set using your gift card ending in 6566420. However, I need to clarify a few important points:\n\n1. **Tool Limitations**: I cannot initiate or process return requests through the available tools.\n\n2. **Return Confirmation**: I cannot process a refund using the gift card ID without the return request being initiated through the store's system.\n\n3. **Order Status**: Order #W6174054 shows as \"Ready for shipment\" status, which means the order hasn't been shipped yet. This is important for return processes.\n\nSince I cannot initiate or process return requests through the available tools, I can help you with returning the items once you've initiated it through your account on the store's website or app, or by contacting customer service directly.\n\n**To initiate the return request, please follow these steps:**\n\n1. **Order #W6174054**: Locate this order in your account or on the store's website.\n2. **Select Items for Return**: Choose the Fleece Jacket, Vacuum Cleaner, and Dumbbell Set to initiate the return.\n3. **Follow Instructions**: You'll receive follow-up email instructions on how and where to return the items.\n4. **Track Status**: Use the order tracking system to monitor the return process.\n\n**For immediate assistance, please contact customer service directly.** The human agent may have additional tools that can help with initiating and tracking the return process.\n\nWould you like me to connect you to a human agent for further assistance with initiating the return request?
