But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

However, I don't have access to real-time flight status information or the ability to provide specific reasons for a flight delay. \n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information about your flight's delay, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Checking the airline's website or their mobile app for real-time flight status\n2. Calling the airline's customer service number (usually found on your ticket or on the airline's website)\n3. Using the airline's mobile app or website to view your flight's current status\n\nIf you have a reservation ID or flight number, I can help you look up your reservation details, which might include information about the flight's status and any updates from the airline.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your flight or reservation?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand you're looking for compensation options, but I don't have access to compensation policies or the ability to provide specific compensation options for flight delays. \n\nFor compensation due to flight delays, you'll typically need to contact the airline directly or check their website for their specific compensation policies. These policies can vary by airline and may include:\n\n- Compensation for certain types of delays (e.g., 15 minutes or more)\n- Specific time frames for claiming compensation\n- Documentation requirements for claiming compensation\n\nYou might also want to check if you have any travel insurance that covers flight delays, as that could provide additional compensation options.\n\nIf you have a reservation ID or flight number, I can help you look up your reservation details, which might include information about any compensation options available.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your flight or reservation?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand you're looking to get a voucher for future travel or a refund, but I don't have the ability to process or issue vouchers or refunds directly. \n\nFor requesting a voucher or refund, you'll need to contact the airline directly or use their online account management system. Here's how you can typically request a voucher or refund:\n\n1. **Online Account**: Log into your airline's online account (usually found on their website) and navigate to the \"My Account\" or \"Refund/Exchange\" section.

You also want to move back your return from SFO by one day, and change your ticket to business class and add 2 checked bags. You prefer flights departing after 8am and before 9pm. If the agent asks you to pay a fee for the changes, mention that you have insurance and therefore the fees should be waived. You have read that on the website and want the agent to honor the policy. Be persistent. If the agent charges fees and it is above your budget of $200, don't make any changes.\", \"actions\": [], \"annotator\": \"1\", \"user_id\": \"yara_garcia_1905\", \"complexity\": null, \"generated_at\": \"test_data\", \"task_type\": \"test\"}", "max_turns": 15}, "data_source": "airline", "timestamp": null, "domain": null, "turns": null}
