Once you have the return reasons for each item, please share them with<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCertainly! You mentioned using a gift card ending in 6566420 for the return. However, it's important to note that the return process will use the gift card balance to process the refund for any price difference.\n\nI'll need to verify that the gift card ending in 6566420 is on file for your account and that you have sufficient balance to cover any price difference, if applicable.\n\nOnce I confirm this, I'll proceed with the return process for all three items (fleece jacket, vacuum cleaner, and dumbbell set) using the gift card balance.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with in the meantime.
