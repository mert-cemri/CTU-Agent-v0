However, adjusting resolution settings for a camera typically involves configuration options set directly on the device or through software, not through our order modification system. This means we cannot modify the resolution setting for your action camera via our platform.\n\nIf you're looking to change the resolution setting, I recommend checking the camera's user manual or using its companion app (if available). Alternatively, you can contact the manufacturer's support team for guidance on how to adjust the resolution settings on your action camera.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with anything else—such as tracking your order, returning an item, or modifying another purchase! 😊\nuser\nI completely understand, but I'd actually like to adjust a specific order detail. The resolution needs to be changed to 1080p, and I believe this can be done. Could you assist me with this modification using a gift card?\nassistant\nI understand you'd like to modify the resolution setting for your action camera order to 1080p. However, after reviewing the available tools and product functionality, it's important to clarify that **resolution settings are device-specific configurations** and cannot be altered through our order modification system. These settings are typically controlled via the camera's hardware or software (e.g., app or menu), not through a retail order change.\n\nAdditionally, since resolution changes do not correspond to a physical product variant (like color or size), we cannot assign a new item ID or adjust the product details in an order for this reason. Therefore, even if we used a gift card for payment, this modification is not supported within our current system.\n\nIf you'd like help with something else—such as changing an item in your order, returning an item, or updating shipping details—please let me know! I'm here to assist with what we can. 😊\nuser\nI was actually hoping to modify the ordered item itself, changing it from a 4K action camera to a 1080p one. The order ID for this is #W3657213.

Additionally, gift cards can only be used for price differences if such a difference exists and is supported by the system.\\\"}\"}]}}\nuser\nI appreciate your patience. I am able to proceed with modifying your order by changing the action camera's resolution to 1080p using the gift card ending in 7794233 for any necessary adjustments. Is there anything else you need help with?\nassistant\nAfter reviewing the available product details and order information, I must inform you that **resolution (such as 4K vs 1080p) is not a configurable option that can be changed by modifying the item in the order**. Our system does not offer different item variants for resolution settings—only distinct camera models with fixed specifications. As such, we cannot swap the 4K action camera to a 1080p model, even if using a gift card for price differences.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed with a different camera model (for example, a 1080p model with a separate item ID), I’d need to confirm whether that specific model is currently available and if it’s compatible with your order. Let me know if you'd like help exploring available options or checking inventory!\n\nOtherwise, I'm happy to assist with any other requests you may have—such as modifying items, changing addresses, or tracking orders. 😊\nuser\nThank you for checking. If changing the resolution isn't possible, maybe looking into different models would help. For now, let's proceed with modifying the current order using the gift card. Is there anything else you can assist me with today?\nassistant\nI understand your request, but I need to clarify that **changing the resolution or swapping to a different model (like 1080p) is not supported** in our system. The action camera in your order is sold as a fixed product with a specific specification (4K), and we do not offer interchangeable resolution variants through order modifications.\n\nSince no such variant exists, we cannot modify the item in your order to a 1080p version—even with the use of a gift card for price differences.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in exploring alternative cameras or finding a different model with 1080p capability, I can help you look up available options. Would you like me to assist with that? Just let me know! 😊\n\nOtherwise, I'm here to help with anything else you need—whether it's returning an item, updating an address, or tracking your orders.
