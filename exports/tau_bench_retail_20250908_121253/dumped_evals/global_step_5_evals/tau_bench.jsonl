Since the order is still pending, we can proceed with modifying the item to the new color you want, which is blue.\n\nTo complete this modification, I'll need the specific item ID for the Bluetooth speaker in your order. Once I have that, I can proceed with the change.\n\nCould you please provide the item ID for the Bluetooth speaker in your order? This will help me locate the correct item and make the necessary changes. \n\nOnce I have the item ID, I'll be able to assist you further with the color change. Thank you for your patience! \n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to let me know. \n\nI'll be back shortly with the order details. Thank you!
