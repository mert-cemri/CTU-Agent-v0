The product specifications for this skateboard (product ID: 1968349452) do not support such customizations—specifically, the length and design options are fixed and not available for modification.  \n\nThat said, I can confirm that your payment method (PayPal ending in 7916550) is correctly linked to your order, and any price difference from a change in specifications would be processed through this account if such options were available.  \n\nWould you like me to suggest alternative skateboard options that are currently available?

Let me check what modifications are currently possible for your skateboard (product ID: 1968349452) within the available options.  \n\nThe current specifications are:  \n- Deck material: plastic  \n- Length: 31 inch  \n- Design: plain  \n\nBased on the product details, the only available changes are:  \n- Deck material (plastic or wood)  \n- Length (30-inch, 31-inch, or 32-inch)  \n- Design (plain, solid color, or graffiti)  \n\nSo, you can:  \n✅ Change the deck material to wood (if available)  \n✅ Change the length to 30-inch, 31-inch, or 32-inch  \n✅ Change the design to solid color or graffiti  \n\nWould you like to proceed with one of these changes? For example:  \n- Change the deck material to wood?  \n- Change the length to 32 inches?  \n- Change the design to graffiti?  \n\nLet me know your preference, and I’ll update your order accordingly using your PayPal (ending in 7916550) for any price difference.\nuser\nI specifically need the change to 34-inch length and graphic design, and please prioritize getting this done. Can you help make this happen?\nassistant\nI understand that you'd like to change the skateboard to a 34-inch length with a graphic design, but I need to be clear: **this combination is not available** in our current inventory.  \n\nThe product specifications for the skateboard (product ID: 1968349452) are fixed and do not support:  \n- A 34-inch length (the maximum available is 32 inches)  \n- A graphic design (only plain, solid color, or graffiti are available, and graffiti is not a standard option for this model)  \n\nEven though I prioritize your request, we cannot fulfill a change that goes beyond the product's available options.  \n\nWould you like me to:  \n1. Suggest a different length (e.g., 32 inches) with a graphic design?  \n2. Change the deck material to wood instead?  \n3. Keep the current specifications and explore other options?  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed—I'm happy to assist with any feasible change!\nuser\nI understand the options are limited, but let's just try to modify the order to the closest possible option with what’s available.\nassistant\nGreat, I'll help you update your order to the closest available option.  \n\nThe best feasible change would be:  \n✅ **Length: 32 inches** (the maximum available for this skateboard model)  \n✅ **Design: Graffiti** (a graphic-style option available for this product)  \n\nThis is the closest match to your request while staying within the product's available specifications.  \n\nI will now proceed to update your order (#W2974929) with these changes using your PayPal (ending in 7916550) for any price difference.  \n\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"modify_pending_order_items\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"#W2974929\\\", \\\"item_ids\\\": [\\\"3877188862\\\"], \\\"new_item_ids\\\": [\\\"3877188864\\\"], \\\"payment_method_id\\\": \\\"paypal_7916550\\\"}\"}}]}\nuser\nThat works for me.
