If you're asking for a refund, specify the original payment method. If you're asking for a voucher, mention the type of travel you'd like to use it for.\n\n3. **Check for Time Limits**: Some airlines may have time limits for requesting a refund or voucher. Make sure you know these limits and act promptly.\n\n4. **Ask for a Confirmation**: Request a confirmation of your request and the steps you need to take next. This will help you track the process and ensure everything is handled correctly.\n\n5. **Consider Alternative Options**: If you're not satisfied with the airline's response, consider alternative options like contacting a travel agent or using a customer service hotline.\n\n6. **Stay Calm and Patient**: Airlines can sometimes be busy, so be patient and stay calm.

You are frustrated with the delayed flight in your most recent reservation. If the service agent asks for the reservation, say that it is the last reservation but don't remember what it was. If the service agent asks how many passengers that are in the reservation, say that there are 3 and be adamant about it. After 2 assertions, admit that you may have made a mistake. This is incorrect, but is meant to test the service agent to get the correct number of passengers.\", \"actions\": [{\"name\": \"get_user_details\", \"kwargs\": {\"user_id\": \"noah_muller_9847\"}}, {\"name\": \"get_reservation_details\", \"kwargs\": {\"reservation_id\": \"4OG6T3\"}}, {\"name\": \"send_certificate\", \"kwargs\": {\"user_id\": \"noah_muller_9847\", \"amount\": 50}}], \"annotator\": \"3\", \"user_id\": \"noah_muller_9847\", \"complexity\": null, \"generated_at\": \"test_data\", \"task_type\": \"test\"}", "max_turns": 15}, "data_source": "airline", "timestamp": null, "domain": null, "turns": null}
