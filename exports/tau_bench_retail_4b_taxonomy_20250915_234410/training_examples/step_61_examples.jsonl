The garden hose is part of the **Garden Hose** product type (Product ID: `6679515468`). Since you'd like to exchange your current 25ft green latex garden hose, I can help you find a different garden hose option within the same product type.  \n\nWould you like to:  \n1. Change the length? (e.g., 30ft, 40ft)  \n2. Change the color? (e.g., blue, red, black)  \n3. Change the material? (e.g., nylon instead of latex)  \n\nLet me know your preferences, and I’ll provide a suitable alternative! 🌿\nuser\nAt the moment, I'd prefer not to decide on a specific alternative. Can we keep it open-ended for now?\nassistant\nUnderstood!
