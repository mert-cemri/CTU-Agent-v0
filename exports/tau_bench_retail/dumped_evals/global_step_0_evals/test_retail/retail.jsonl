It seems that there are no coffee machines available with a pressure of 8 bar or 9 bar in our inventory.\n\nGiven this, we will need to proceed with the exchange for the coffee machine to a different model that matches your requirements as closely as possible. We will then look into the laptop exchange.\n\nLet's start by finding a coffee machine with a pressure similar to 8 bar. If we find one, we can proceed with the exchange.
