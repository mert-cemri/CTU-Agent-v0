Unfortunately, I need the order ID to locate your specific order, but without the zip code, I can't proceed further with the return process.\n\nIf you can't find your zip code, you might consider checking your account details, such as your shipping address, which you can often find in your email or account profile.\n\nIf you have access to any recent emails from us, they usually contain the order ID and other important details. If you're not sure where to find it, I can attempt to find your account using your name and email address again. \n\nIf you prefer, you could try to log in to your account on our website and find your order there. That should show your order ID along with the item details you wish to return.\n\nWhich option would you prefer to try? Once we have the order ID, I'll be able to assist you with the return process. \n\nI apologize if this process seems confusing. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! \n\nOnce you have the order ID from your account, please let me know, and I'll be ready to assist you with the return of your air purifier. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask.
