Since the original purchase was made using your gift card (gift_card_2519457), the refund will be applied to that same gift card balance first, rather than going directly to your PayPal account.  \n\nHere’s what will happen:  \n- The $308.38 refund will be credited back to your gift card (gift_card_2519457).  \n- You’ll see the balance updated in your gift card account immediately.  \n\nThis is a standard practice to ensure the refund goes back to the original payment method.
