I found the available gas, portable grill options. Here's what's available in the same product type:\n\n- **Gas, portable, side burner** (item ID: 9724317332)  \n  - Price: $1,042.19  \n  - Available: Yes  \n\n- **Gas, portable, no features** (item ID: 5946177616)  \n  - Price: $1,057.24  \n  - Available: Yes  \n\nThe electric grill you currently have (medium, side burner) is priced at $1,058.86, so the gas portable models are slightly cheaper or comparable.  \n\n### Next Steps:\nWould you like to:\n1. Replace your current electric grill (item ID: 5666020311) with the **gas, portable, side burner** (item ID: 9724317332)?  \n2. Or go with the **gas, portable, no features** (item ID: 5946177616)?  \n\nAlso, please confirm if you'd like to proceed with this change. I'll need your explicit \"yes\" to proceed.  \n\nOnce confirmed, I’ll update your order with the new item and adjust the payment accordingly (using your current credit card).  \n\nLet me know your choice!\nuser\nI'd like to go with the gas, portable, no features option.
