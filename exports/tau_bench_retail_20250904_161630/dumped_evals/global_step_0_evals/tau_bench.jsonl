If there's anything else you need help with, feel free to let me know. Have a great day!<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nNo worries at all! It's completely normal to feel a bit unsure, especially when dealing with online transactions. Here are a few things you might want to double-check:\n\n1. **Order Confirmation Email**: Make sure you have received an email confirmation from the order. This will typically include the order ID and details of the cancellation.\n\n2. **Payment Method**: Ensure that the payment was successfully refunded to the correct method. If you used a gift card, the refund should be added to your gift card balance immediately. If it was a credit card, it may take 5-7 business days to process.\n\n3. **Order Status**: Check the order status in your account to confirm that the order is marked as \"cancelled.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nYou're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.
