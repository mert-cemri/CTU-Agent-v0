It costs $487.67, which is slightly more than your current chair ($466.44), so there will be a price difference of **$21.23**.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this change? If so, I'll need to confirm the following:\n- You agree to the new item (mesh, blue, fixed armrest, standard backrest)\n- You confirm the price difference will be covered using your current payment method (`credit_card_6680679`)\n\nPlease reply with **\"yes\"** to proceed or let me know if you'd like to choose a different option.\nuser\nYes, I'd like to go with the mesh, blue, fixed armrest, and standard backrest option.
