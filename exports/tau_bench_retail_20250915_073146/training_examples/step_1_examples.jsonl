I'll be patient while you look it up. Let me know if there's anything else needed from my side.\nassistant\nOf course, I'll proceed immediately to find the order ID for you.\n\nI will call the function now to locate the order ID using the T-shirt item type and the PayPal payment method ID.\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"find_user_id_by_product_payment\", \"arguments\": {\"item_type\": \"T-shirt\", \"payment_method_id\": \"paypal_6882355\"}}}]}\nuser\nThank you! Take your time, and I'm here if you need any more details from me.\nassistant\nYou're welcome! I am almost done with the initial lookup. \n\nLet's see if we can find the order ID using the T-shirt item type and the PayPal payment method ID.\n\nI will call the function now to retrieve the order ID.\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"find_user_id_by_product_payment\", \"arguments\": {\"item_type\": \"T-shirt\", \"payment_method_id\": \"paypal_6882355\"}}}]}\n\nIf we do not find the order ID, we might need to look into the order details manually. Please bear with me as I continue with the process.\nuser\nSure thing, I'm here and ready to continue once we have the order ID.\nassistant\nThank you for your patience.
