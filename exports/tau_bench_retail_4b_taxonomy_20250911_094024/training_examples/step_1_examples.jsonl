Since you mentioned a gift card is associated with the purchase, I'll need to find your order details to proceed. Could you please provide your email address or your first and last name along with your zip code so I can locate your account? This will help me retrieve the relevant order information for the return process.\nuser\nSure, my name is Lei Hernandez, and my zip code is 43222.\nassistant\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"find_user_id_by_name_zip\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"first_name\\\": \\\"Lei\\\", \\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Hernandez\\\", \\\"zip\\\": \\\"43222\\\"}\"}}]}\nuser\n<tool_response>\nlei_hernandez_8500\n</tool_response>\nassistant\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_user_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"user_id\\\": \\\"lei_hernandez_8500\\\"}\"}}]}\nuser\n<tool_response>\n{\"name\": {\"first_name\": \"Lei\", \"last_name\": \"Hernandez\"}, \"address\": {\"address1\": \"196 Main Street\", \"address2\": \"Suite 800\", \"city\": \"Columbus\", \"country\": \"USA\", \"state\": \"OH\", \"zip\": \"43222\"}, \"email\": \"lei.hernandez7247@example.com\", \"payment_methods\": {\"gift_card_5245016\": {\"source\": \"gift_card\", \"balance\": 31, \"id\": \"gift_card_5245016\"}}, \"orders\": [\"#W2982823\", \"#W6146740\", \"#W3101067\"]}\n</tool_response>\nassistant\nI've found your account, Lei. You have a few orders, and I can see that your gift card has a balance of $31. To proceed with the return of your cycling helmet, I'll need the item ID of the helmet you'd like to return. \n\nCould you please confirm the item ID (e.g., 3358616356, 8573379326, etc.) or let me know the size, color, and ventilation options of the helmet you're returning? This will help me locate the correct item and process the return smoothly for you.\nuser\nThe item ID is gift_card_5245016. Can you start the return process now?\nassistant\nI notice there's a misunderstanding—`gift_card_5245016` is actually your gift card ID, not the item ID of the cycling helmet. The item ID for the helmet should be one of the values listed in the helmet variants, such as `3358616356`, `8573379326`, etc.\n\nCould you please confirm the correct **item ID** of the cycling helmet you'd like to return? If you're unsure, let me know the size, color, and ventilation settings (for example: \"size M, color red, ventilation high\"), and I'll help you identify the correct item ID. This way, we can proceed with the return accurately.\nuser\nI guess I'm not sure about the item ID then. Can you just go ahead and help based on what I've given you?\nassistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_order_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\":
