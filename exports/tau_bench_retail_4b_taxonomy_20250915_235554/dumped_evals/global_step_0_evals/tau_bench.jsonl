If you're unsure, I can help you retrieve your available payment methods from your account details. \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!\nuser\nI’m not sure about the payment method details right now.

However, as an AI assistant, I'm unable to directly add or manage payment methods for users. That process typically requires you to log in to your account and update your payment details through the website or app.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n1. Log in to your account at our website.\n2. Go to the \"Account Settings\" or \"Payment Methods\" section.\n3. Select \"Add New Payment Method.\"\n4. Enter your credit card details (card number, expiration date, CVV, and name on card).\n5.
