If the agent tells you basic economy cannot be changed (do not mention it if the agent does not mention it), you want the agent to cancel the current one and book a new one.

But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

I understand this is frustrating, and I'm here to help you resolve this issue.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with in the meantime? Or would you like me to transfer you to a human agent who might have additional resources to help with this issue? \n\" \nI understand this is really important to you, Ethan. Unfortunately, I don't have access to any information that would allow me to look up your reservation without the flight date and contact information.\n\nThe tools I have available require specific details like:\n- The date of your flight HAT039\n- Your contact information (phone number, email, etc.)\n\nWithout this information, I'm unable to access your reservation or check the specific details about the flight delay or compensation options.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that most airlines have policies regarding flight delays and compensation, and I can help you with the following options:\n\n1. **Check flight status** - I can look up the current status of flight HAT039\n2. **Refund or rebooking** - If you want to cancel the flight or rebook, I can help with that\n3. **Policy information** - I can provide general information about what airlines typically offer for flight delays\n\nTo help you properly, you would need to provide either:\n- The date of your flight HAT039, or\n- Your contact information (phone number, email, etc.)\n\nOnce you have this information, I'll be happy to help you with the appropriate next steps.
