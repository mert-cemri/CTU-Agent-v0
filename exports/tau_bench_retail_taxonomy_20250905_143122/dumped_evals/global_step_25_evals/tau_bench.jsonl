However, I need to clarify a few things before proceeding:\n\n1. **Order Status**: I notice that order #W3746173 is still pending. This means the order hasn't been processed yet, so we can't change the payment method at this stage.\n\n2. **Pending Orders**: For a pending order, the payment method can only be changed once. After the order is processed, you can change the payment method as needed.\n\n3. **Processing**: Once the order is processed, you can change the payment method through the order details or account settings.\n\nSince the order is still pending, I can't change the payment method at this time. However, once the order is processed, you'll be able to change the payment method through your account settings.\n\nWould you like to proceed with processing the order first, or would you prefer to wait until the order is processed before changing the payment method? \n\nIf you'd like to process the order now, I can help with that.
