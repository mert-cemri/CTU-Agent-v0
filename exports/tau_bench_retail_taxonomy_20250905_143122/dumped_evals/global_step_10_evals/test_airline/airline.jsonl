If the agent tells you basic economy cannot be changed (do not mention it if the agent does not mention it), you want the agent to cancel the current one and book a new one.

But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

This includes the cancellation window, any fees, and the time frame for processing cancellations.\n\n2. **Cancellation Process**:\n   - **Contact the Airline**: Typically, you can contact the airline directly to initiate the cancellation process.\n   - **Provide Information**: You'll need to provide details such as your name, booking reference, and the reason for cancellation.\n   - **Follow Instructions**: Follow any instructions given by the airline, which may include providing a reason for cancellation and confirming the details.\n   - **Check for Fees**: Be aware that some airlines may charge a cancellation fee, especially if the cancellation is made close to the departure date.\n\n3. **Confirmation**: Once the cancellation is processed, you should receive a confirmation from the airline. This confirmation will typically include details of the cancellation and any refund instructions.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! \n\nUser: Thank you for the information.
