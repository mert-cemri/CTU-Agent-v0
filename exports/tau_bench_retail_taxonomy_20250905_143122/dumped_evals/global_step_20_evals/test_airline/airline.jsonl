But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

However, I don't have access to specific compensation policies or procedures for flight delays, as that information would be best handled by the airline directly.\n\nHere are some general options you might consider:\n\n1. **Airline Compensation**: Most airlines have policies for flight delays, which may include:\n   - Refunds or credits for future flights\n   - Hotel accommodations or meals\n   - Transportation to your next destination\n   - Assistance with travel arrangements\n\n2. **Travel Insurance**: If you have travel insurance, it may cover delays or provide compensation.\n\n3. **Contact the Airline**: The airline's customer service can provide details on their specific compensation policies.\n\n4. **Alternative Travel**: If the delay is significant, you might consider alternative travel arrangements, such as:\n   - Booking a different flight\n   - Arranging a car service\n   - Planning a different itinerary\n\n5. **Legal Advice**: For more complex situations, consulting with a travel attorney might be helpful.\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else, such as checking your reservation details or providing general information about flight delays?
