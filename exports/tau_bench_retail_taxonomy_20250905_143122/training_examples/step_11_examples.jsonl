Without them, I won't be able to proceed with the exchange or removal of specific items.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to exchange the Indoor Security Camera for one with a 130-degree field of view, and remove all details from the Tea Kettle. However, without the specific item IDs, I won't be able to make these changes.\n\nCould you please check your account or records to find the item IDs for these products? Once you have the item IDs, I'll be happy to assist you with the modifications.\n\nIf you need help finding these IDs, let me know, and I'll guide you through the process.
