You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.
