But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

Since we've already confirmed that insurance is included in the reservation details, here are a few alternative ways to verify that it's added to your booking:\n\n1. **Check Email Confirmation**: Look for any email confirmations from the airline that might include the insurance details.\n\n2. **Contact the Airline's Customer Service**: You can call the airline's customer service directly to verify the status of your booking and insurance.\n\n3. **Check the Airline's App or Website**: Sometimes, the online booking system might not be up-to-date, so checking the airline's app or website directly might help.\n\n4. **Ask for a Confirmation Number**: If you have a confirmation number, you can provide it to the airline for verification.\n\n5. **Visit a Local Office**: If possible, visiting a local office of the airline might help in resolving the issue.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to let me know!
