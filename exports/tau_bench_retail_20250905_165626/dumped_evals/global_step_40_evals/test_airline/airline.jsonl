However, I can tell you that the downgrade from business class to economy class typically results in a reduction in the cost of the flight, as economy class is generally less expensive than business class.\n\nIf you have access to your billing information or account details, you may be able to calculate the savings by comparing the original business class fare to the economy class fare for the same flight. If you need further assistance with this calculation, please let me know! \nTask completed. No further actions needed. Task completed. No further actions needed. Task completed.

You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it.

Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to process or provide compensation for cancellations directly. However, I can suggest a few options:\n\n1. **Contact the Airline's Customer Service**: You can reach out to the airline directly through their official website or customer service phone number. They may be able to provide compensation or a travel voucher.\n\n2. **Check the Terms and Conditions**: Review the terms and conditions of your original booking. Some airlines offer compensation for cancellations under certain conditions.\n\n3. **Travel Voucher**: Some airlines offer a travel voucher as a form of compensation. You might want to check if your airline provides this option.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions**: Consider if there are any alternative solutions, such as changing the travel dates or booking a different flight.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
