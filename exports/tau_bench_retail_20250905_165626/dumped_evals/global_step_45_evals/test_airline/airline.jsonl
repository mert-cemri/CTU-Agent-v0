Unfortunately, without the specific ID or the amount stored on the card, I'm unable to directly access the balance information. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:\n\n1. **Check Your Account:** You can log into your online account with the airline or visit their website to view your gift card balances.\n   \n2. **Contact Customer Support:** You can call the airline's customer service and provide them with your account details to verify the balance.\n\n3. **Check Email or Text Messages:** Sometimes, transaction confirmations or emails from the airline may include the balance details.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to let me know!

You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card.

If you can provide the name of the passenger, the date of the flight, and the origin and destination airports, I can help you find the reservation ID. Once I have that information, I can assist you with the cancellation process.\n  reply\nThe name of the passenger is \"John Doe\", the date of the flight is \"2024-05-15\", and the origin and destination airports are \"SFO\" and \"LAX\". Could you help me find the reservation ID for this flight?\n  reply\nI can help you find the reservation ID for John Doe's flight from SFO to LAX on May 15, 2024. However, I need the complete reservation ID to proceed with the cancellation. \n\nIf you have any other details like the payment method or any other identifying information, that would be helpful. Alternatively, if you have the reservation ID, I can proceed with the cancellation right away. \n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed!\n  reply\nI don't have the reservation ID with me right now. Is there anything else I can do to help you locate the reservation?\n  reply\nI understand. Unfortunately, without the reservation ID, I won't be able to locate the specific reservation in our system. However, if you can provide any other identifying information, such as the payment method or any other details associated with the booking, I might be able to assist you further.\n\nIf you have access to any emails, confirmations, or other documents related to the booking, those might contain the reservation ID. If you're unable to find it, you may need to contact customer support directly for assistance.\n\nIf there's anything else I can help you with, please let me know!\n  reply\nThank you for your help.
