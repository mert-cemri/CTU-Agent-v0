However, based on the system's available tools, we cannot remove a single item from a pending order. The available options are either to:  \n- Cancel the entire order, or  \n- Modify items (e.g., exchange them for different ones), but not remove them entirely.  \n\nSince removing just the Makeup Kit isn't supported, I recommend either:  \n1. **Exchanging** the Makeup Kit for a different item (if you'd like to replace it), or  \n2. **Canceling the entire order** if you no longer want any items.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with exchanging the Makeup Kit for another item, or would you prefer to cancel the order entirely? Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 😊\nuser\nIn that case, could we leave the order as it is right now with the updated payment and shipping information? I appreciate your help with this.\nassistant\nOf course! Your order #W3746173 is now active with the updated shipping address and payment method.
