Unfortunately, the available tools do not support changing the type of an item (like from automatic to manual) directly. The system appears to only allow modifications such as changing items, addresses, or payment methods, and the espresso machine's type seems to be a fixed attribute of the product.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed with a different espresso machine that's manual, I can help you find a manual espresso machine and assist with adding it to your order (if it's available). Would you like me to do that? Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep the current automatic machine, let me know and I can assist with any other changes you'd like to make.\nuser\nI would appreciate that, but I also need to make
