I see that the **Espresso Machine** has the product ID `4354588079`. Since you mentioned wanting to tweak its pressure and change the type, let’s clarify a few things:\n\n1. **Product Type**: Espresso machines are under the \"Espresso Machine\" product type. We can’t change the product type itself (it's fixed), but we might be able to adjust settings like pressure or model within that category.\n2. **Item IDs**: Each item in your order has a unique item ID (like 1008292230). You’ll need to provide those specific item IDs so I can locate them in your order.\n3. **Changes Allowed**: For pending orders, we can modify items to different versions of the same product type (e.g., different pressure settings or models). However, if the order is already shipped, we’d need to process a return or exchange instead.\n\nCould you please confirm:\n- The order ID (starts with #W and ends with numbers)?\n- The item IDs of the espresso machine(s) you'd like to change?\n\nOnce I have those details, I’ll help you proceed safely and clearly! 😊\nuser\nI just have the order ID #W2541482 in mind. For the espresso machine, I'm thinking of changing the pressure to 9 bar and switching it to use capsules instead.
