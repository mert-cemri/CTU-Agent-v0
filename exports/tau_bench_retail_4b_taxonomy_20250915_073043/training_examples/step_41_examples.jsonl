We have a perfect match for your request:\n\n🔹 Current vacuum cleaner: Robotic, bagless, with pet hair removal ($620.07)  \n🔹 New option: Robotic, bagless, cordless ($658.89)  \n\nThis change will increase the total cost by $38.82, which will be charged to your PayPal account (the original payment method).  \n\n**Important notes:**  \n- The cordless version maintains your preferred \"bagless\" setting  \n- The vacuum will remain robotic (same type)  \n- This is a confirmed available variant (item ID: 4806644905)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this change? Please confirm with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"\nuser\nYes, please proceed with updating the vacuum cleaner's features.\nassistant\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"modify_pending_order_items\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"#W1430028\\\", \\\"item_ids\\\": [\\\"4965355367\\\"], \\\"new_item_ids\\\": [\\\"4806644905\\\"], \\\"payment_method_id\\\": \\\"paypal_5206520\\\"}\"}}]}\ntool\n<tool_response>\nError: non-pending order cannot be modified\n</tool_response>\nassistant\nI apologize for the error. It appears that your order has moved from \"pending\" to a different status, which means we can no longer modify the items. \n\nHere's what happened:\n- Your initial order (#W1430028) was originally pending and allowed modifications\n- After changing the running shoes, the system likely updated the order status to \"processed\" or \"shipped\"\n- Once an order moves beyond pending status, item modifications are no longer possible\n\nWhile we can't make further changes to this order, here are your options:\n1. Wait until you receive your package and contact us if you'd like to exchange or return any items  \n2. Place a new order with the yellow running shoes and cordless vacuum cleaner (we can assist with that)  \n3. Contact our support team directly for alternative solutions  \n\nWould you like me to help you create a new order with these preferred items? Or would you prefer to explore another option?\nuser\nNo problem. I'll wait until the package arrives and consider my options then. In the meantime, I have a few more requests.\nassistant\nI'd be happy to assist you with additional requests! Please let me know what you need help with—whether it's related to orders, product information, account details, or anything else. Just share the specifics, and I'll do my best to help. 😊\nuser\nI'd like to return a few items from order #W2922433.
