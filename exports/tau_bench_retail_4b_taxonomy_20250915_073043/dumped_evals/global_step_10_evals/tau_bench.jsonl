If so, please confirm which one you'd like, and I'll update your order.  \n\nNote: This change can only be made once, and the payment method on file (gift card) will handle the price difference.\nuser\nI'll go for the blue with 10 hours of battery life and no water resistance.\nassistant\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"modify_pending_order_items\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"#W9160732\\\", \\\"item_ids\\\": [\\\"7597543861\\\"], \\\"new_item_ids\\\": [\\\"6704763132\\\"], \\\"payment_method_id\\\": \\\"gift_card_5979071\\\"}\"}}]}\nuser\n<tool_response>\n{\"order_id\": \"#W9160732\", \"user_id\": \"aarav_gonzalez_5113\", \"address\": {\"address1\": \"264 River Road\", \"address2\": \"Suite 604\", \"city\": \"San Antonio\", \"country\": \"USA\", \"state\": \"TX\", \"zip\": \"78268\"}, \"items\": [{\"name\": \"Water Bottle\", \"product_id\": \"8310926033\", \"item_id\": \"2366567022\", \"price\": 54.04, \"options\": {\"capacity\": \"1000ml\", \"material\": \"stainless steel\", \"color\": \"blue\"}}, {\"name\": \"Bluetooth Speaker\", \"product_id\": \"4768869376\", \"item_id\": \"6704763132\", \"price\": 305.45, \"options\": {\"color\": \"blue\", \"battery life\": \"10 hours\", \"water resistance\": \"no\"}}, {\"name\": \"Wall Clock\", \"product_id\": \"2344688344\", \"item_id\": \"8610532516\", \"price\": 203.76, \"options\": {\"diameter\": \"10 inches\", \"color\": \"black\", \"type\": \"digital\"}}, {\"name\": \"Patio Umbrella\", \"product_id\": \"9743693396\", \"item_id\": \"3111466194\", \"price\": 285.66, \"options\": {\"size\": \"7 ft\", \"color\": \"red\", \"material\": \"polyester\", \"tilt mechanism\": \"manual tilt\"}}, {\"name\": \"Fleece Jacket\", \"product_id\": \"8560156827\", \"item_id\": \"8590708195\", \"price\": 157.61, \"options\": {\"size\": \"XL\", \"color\": \"navy\", \"zipper\": \"half\"}}], \"fulfillments\": [], \"status\": \"pending (item modified)\", \"payment_history\": [{\"transaction_type\": \"payment\", \"amount\": 1011.54, \"payment_method_id\": \"gift_card_5979071\"}, {\"transaction_type\": \"refund\", \"amount\": 5.020000000000039, \"payment_method_id\": \"gift_card_5979071\"}]}\n</tool_response>\nassistant\nYour order has been successfully updated!
