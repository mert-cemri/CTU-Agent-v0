The 20MP, 3x zoom, SD card version (Item ID: 8363011723) - saving $51.65, or  \n2. The 20MP, 5x zoom, SD card version (Item ID: 9644439410) - increasing the price by $424.70?\n\nAlso, since the price will change, we'll need to adjust the payment method. Your current payment is via gift card (gift_card_8049813). Would you like to proceed with the same gift card for the price difference? \n\nPlease confirm your choice (1 or 2) and let me know if you'd like to use the same gift card for the adjustment.\nuser\nLet's go with the 20MP, 3x zoom option to save some bucks, and yes, I'll stick with the gift card for any adjustments.
