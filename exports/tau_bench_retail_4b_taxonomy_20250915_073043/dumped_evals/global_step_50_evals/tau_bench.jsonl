And yes, let's proceed with this modification using the credit card.\nassistant\nI understand you'd like to remove the specific variant selection for the Makeup Kit and proceed with the change using your credit card. However, we need to clarify something important:  \n\nThe system does not support removing a specific variant and leaving it \"unselected\" in a pending order. Every item in an order must have a defined variant (skin tone, size, brand) to be processed.  \n\nIf you'd like, we can instead:  \n1. Keep the current variant (Medium, Professional, Brand A) — which is still available and priced at $261.11.  \n2. Or switch to a different available variant (e.g., Dark, Professional, Brand C at $235.44).  \n\nWould you like to proceed with one of the available options above, or would you prefer to keep the current one?  \n\nIf you confirm a new variant, I’ll update the order using your credit card for any price difference.

It seems we cannot remove an item from the order by setting the `new_item_ids` to an empty array — the system requires that the number of items being modified matches the number of items being replaced.  \n\nTo remove the Makeup Kit entirely, we would need to either:  \n1. Replace it with a different item (even if it's a different variant), or  \n2. Process a full exchange or cancellation (which isn't possible for a pending order without a replacement).  \n\nSince we cannot simply remove an item without replacing it, I recommend one of the following options:  \n\n✅ **Option 1:** Replace the Makeup Kit with a different available variant (e.g., Dark, Professional, Brand C at $235.44).  \n✅ **Option 2:** Cancel the entire order (if you no longer need it).  \n\nWould you like to proceed with replacing the Makeup Kit with a different variant, or would you prefer to cancel the order instead? Let me know how you'd like to move forward! 😊\nuser\nLet's cancel the Makeup Kit from this order, and I'll handle any adjustments with the credit card.\nassistant\nI understand you'd like to cancel the Makeup Kit from the order. However, due to system limitations, we cannot remove a single item from a pending order without replacing it with another item of the same product type.  \n\nTo proceed, we have two options:  \n1. **Replace** the Makeup Kit with a different available variant (e.g., Dark, Professional, Brand C at $235.44).  \n2. **Cancel the entire order** (if you no longer need it).  \n\nWould you like to:  \n- Replace the item with a different variant (I can help you pick one), or  \n- Cancel the entire order #W3746173?  \n\nPlease let me know your preference, and I’ll assist accordingly! 😊\nuser\nI understand. In that case, let's just proceed with making no selection for the Makeup Kit. I'll take care of everything on my end. Thank you!\nassistant\nI understand your preference, but unfortunately, the system does not allow removing or leaving an item unselected in a pending order. Every item must have a defined variant to be processed.  \n\nSince we cannot proceed with removing the Makeup Kit without a replacement or full order cancellation, I recommend one of the following:  \n- Replace it with a different available variant (e.g., Dark, Professional, Brand C at $235.44), or  \n- Cancel the entire order if you no longer need it.  \n\nIf you'd like, I can help you proceed with either option. Otherwise, I’ll close this assistance session.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with one of these alternatives, or would you like to cancel the entire order? Let me know how you'd like to move forward! 😊\nuser\nIn that case, let's leave it as it is for now. On another note, I need to cancel order #W1416704 since it was placed by mistake.
