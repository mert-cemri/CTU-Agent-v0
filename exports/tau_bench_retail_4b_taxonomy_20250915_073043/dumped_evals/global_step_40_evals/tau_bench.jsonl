Our system does not support removing individual items from a pending order in this way.

Our platform does not allow partial removal or modification of items in a way that leaves them empty. Each item in an order must either be fully included or removed entirely, and removing it would require either:\n\n- Canceling the entire order, or  \n- Replacing it with a different item.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you cancel the order or replace the Makeup Kit with another option.
