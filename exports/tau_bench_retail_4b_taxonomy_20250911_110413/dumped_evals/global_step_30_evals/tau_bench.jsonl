Let me know! 😊\nuser\nThe order ID is #W6114312. I'd like to exchange a dumbbell set I ordered.\nassistant\nCould you please provide the item ID of the dumbbell set you'd like to exchange? Also, let me know the new item ID you'd like to receive (ensuring it's the same product type). Finally, confirm your preferred payment method for any price difference (e.g., credit card or gift card).  \n\nThis will help me process the exchange smoothly! 😊\nuser\nI don't have the item IDs with me, but I can share some details. I'd like to swap my current dumbbell set, which is adjustable, rubber, and between 30-50 lbs, for a fixed dumbbell set in the 5-25 lbs range that's made of urethane. Payment method remains the same—credit card ending in 8169552.\nassistant\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_order_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\":
