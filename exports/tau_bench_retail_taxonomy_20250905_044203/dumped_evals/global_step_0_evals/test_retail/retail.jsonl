Check your order confirmation email from the online store\n2. Look at the order history in the online store's account section\n3. Contact customer service directly for a shipping status inquiry\n\nThe order confirmation email typically includes the estimated delivery date and tracking information if available.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand you'd like to cancel the air purifier if it hasn't been shipped yet.

Contact customer service directly\n2. Use the online store's account or order modification feature\n3. Compare prices of different air purifier models\n\nIf you have the order ID, I can help you with other order modifications once the order is in a \"pending\" or \"processing\" status.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nYes, if you modify the air purifier to a different option and the price difference results in a refund, you can choose to have the refund added to your gift card balance.\n\nWhen you modify an order, you'll have the option to:\n- Receive a refund to your gift card\n- Receive a refund to your credit card\n- Use the refund to pay for another item in your order\n\nSo if the cheaper option results in a refund, you can choose to have that refund added to your gift card balance.\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else once you have your order ID?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand you'd like to find your gift card information, but unfortunately I don't have access to tools that can search through account details or retrieve gift card information without specific order IDs or user IDs.\n\nTo find your gift card information, you would need to:\n1. Log into your account on the online store\n2. Go to your account settings or profile\n3. Look for the \"Gift Cards\" section\n\nIf you have your user ID (which you provided as ivan_hernandez_6923), I can help you with other account-related tasks once you have your order ID.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nYou're welcome!

This will help me provide you with the specific status details for each order.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI understand your situation, but unfortunately, I need the user ID to access the order details in the system.

That sounds like a great plan.
