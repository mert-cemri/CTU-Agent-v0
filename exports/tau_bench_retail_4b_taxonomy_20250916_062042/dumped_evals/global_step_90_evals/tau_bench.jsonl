I'll process the return request for the jigsaw puzzle.  \n2. You'll receive a follow-up email with instructions on how and where to return the item.  \n3. Once we receive the returned item, the refund will be processed to your payment method (gift card **gift_card_1725971**).

Just to clarify, the correct item we're returning is associated with the ID gift_card_1725971. Let me know if this helps resolve the issue.\nassistant\nThank you for the clarification, James. Since the item ID **1808611083** (Jigsaw Puzzle) is tied to the gift card **gift_card_1725971**, I understand you're trying to return the puzzle linked to that payment method.  \n\nHowever, the error indicates that the item ID **1808611083** is not present in order **#W3638028**. This suggests the puzzle may not have been part of that order, or there's a mismatch in the item details.  \n\nTo ensure accuracy, I’ll verify the full order details of **#W3638028** to confirm if the jigsaw puzzle was actually purchased and what the correct item ID might be.  \n\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_order_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"#W3638028\\\"}\"}}]}\nuser\nI understand this is getting complicated.

Let me take a step back and help clarify things carefully.  \n\nHere’s what we know:  \n- You want to return a **jigsaw puzzle**.  \n- The puzzle is linked to the gift card **gift_card_1725971**.  \n- You believe it was part of order **#W3638028**, but the system is showing the item ID **1808611083** is not found in that order.  \n\nTo resolve this, I’ll check the full details of order **#W3638028** to see if the jigsaw puzzle was actually purchased and what the correct item ID might be.
