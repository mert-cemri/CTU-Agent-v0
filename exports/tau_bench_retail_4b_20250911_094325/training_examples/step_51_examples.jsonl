If you remember any part of the order (like the date, approximate time of purchase, or other items ordered), I can help you search for it using your account details.\n2. If you’re logged into your account or have a user ID, I can retrieve your order history.\n3. Alternatively, if you’d like, I can guide you on how to check your order history in our system via your account dashboard.\n\nWould you be able to provide:\n- Your email address (to verify your account)?\n- Your first and last name?\n- A zip code associated with your account?\n\nWith this information, I can attempt to find your user ID and then retrieve your order history to locate the dumbbell set order.

However, we can assist with an exchange or return if needed.\n\n### Options available:\n1. **Exchange** the current 30–50 lbs dumbbell set to a 5–25 lbs set (if available in stock).  \n2. **Return** the current set and place a new one with the desired weight range.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with either option?
