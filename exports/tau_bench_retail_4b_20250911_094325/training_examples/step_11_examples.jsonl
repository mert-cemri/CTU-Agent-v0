Based on your request, here’s what we found:  \n\n- Your current smartwatch (silver, leather band, LCD display) is **item ID: 9811090008**, and it's eligible for exchange.  \n- The **gold smartwatch with an AMOLED display** is available in two configurations:  \n  - **Gold, silicone band, AMOLED display**: Item ID `2681513500`, priced at $356.23. ✅ Available  \n  - **Gold, leather band, AMOLED display**: Item ID `5694328282`, priced at $323.19. ✅ Available  \n\nSince you specifically mentioned a gold watch with an AMOLED display, both options meet your criteria.  \n\n### Exchange Details:\n- **Current item to exchange**: Silver, leather band, LCD (Item ID: 9811090008) → Price: $370.38  \n- **New item to receive**: Gold, silicone/leather band, AMOLED → Price: $356.23 / $323.19  \n- **Price difference**:  \n  - If choosing silicone band ($356.23): You’ll receive a refund of **$14.15** (difference).  \n  - If choosing leather band ($323.19): You’ll receive a refund of **$47.19** (difference).  \n\nThe refund will be applied to your original payment method (**PayPal ending in 3684705**) within 5–7 business days.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with either option? Just confirm which one you'd prefer (e.g., \"I’d like the gold with silicone band\"), and I’ll process the exchange! 🚀\nuser\nActually, I believe the purchase was made with my credit card ending in 7801956.

However, if you'd like to keep the original Tea Kettle (or exchange it for another item), we can proceed with that.  \n- Alternatively, if you’d prefer to **replace it entirely**, we can exchange it for one of the available options above — just let me know which one appeals most to you.  \n\nWould you like to:\n1. Proceed with exchanging the **security camera** (to 130° field of view) and pick a new Tea Kettle?  \n2. Keep the original Tea Kettle and only exchange the camera?  \n3. Or explore another solution (like a partial refund or store credit)?  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to move forward — I’m happy to help finalize it! 😊\nuser\nLet's proceed with exchanging the security camera for the one with the 130° field of view.
