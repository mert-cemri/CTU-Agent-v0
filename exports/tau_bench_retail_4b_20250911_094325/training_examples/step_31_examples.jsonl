Here are some available options for new helmets you can choose from (same product type):  \n\n- Size S, Color Blue, High Ventilation  \n- Size M, Color Red, High Ventilation  \n- Size L, Color Black, High Ventilation  \n- Size M, Color Blue, Medium Ventilation  \n- Size L, Color Green, High Ventilation  \n\nWould you like me to help you pick one based on your preferences (e.g., size, color, ventilation)? Or would you prefer to select one yourself?  \n\nAlso, note that since your original payment was made via a gift card (`gift_card_5437583`), any price difference between the old and new helmet will be handled through that same gift card. However, if you’d like to use PayPal instead, we’ll need to adjust the payment method accordingly.  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed! 😊\nuser\nHmm, I'm sticking with medium size. I'm torn between the red and the one with medium ventilation. Can I pick one now and switch later if needed?\nassistant\nGreat question! Right now, here’s what we can do:  \n\n- You **can’t make a final exchange decision yet** because the system only allows one exchange per order (for delivered items).  \n- However, you can **select a new helmet now**, and we’ll proceed with the exchange. If you change your mind later, we’ll need to contact support to request a reversal or reassignment—since exchanges are limited to one.  \n\nSo, to confirm:  \n✅ You want a **medium-sized** helmet.  \n✅ You’re choosing between:  \n   - **Red, high ventilation** (your current option)  \n   - **Blue, medium ventilation** (a slightly less ventilated option)  \n\n👉 Can you confirm which one you’d like to go with? Once selected, I’ll process the exchange with your existing gift card for any price difference.  \n\nJust say “red with high ventilation” or “blue with medium ventilation,” and I’ll finalize it! 🚴‍♂️✨\nuser\nAlright, I'm going with the red with high ventilation.
