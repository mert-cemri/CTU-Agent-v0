I've checked the availability of the options you requested. Here's what we found:\n\n### For the **Digital Camera** (resolution change to 20MP):\n- A **20MP, 3x zoom, SD card** version is available with item ID **8363011723** at a price of **$2,823.96**.  \n- This is a better option than the 30MP version you currently have, and it's available now.  \n\n### For the **Electric Kettle** (material change to glass):\n- A **1L, glass, black** version is available with item ID **2323972008** at a price of **$146.98**.  \n- A **1L, glass, silver** version is also available (item ID 1240311797, $137.17).  \n- A **1.5L, glass, white** version is available too (item ID 9472539378, $143.72).  \n\nYou can choose any of these glass options.  \n\n### Price Difference:\n- The Digital Camera change will result in a **refund of $51.65** (from $2,875.61 to $2,823.96).  \n- The Electric Kettle change will result in a **surcharge of $1.73** (from $153.25 to $146.98).  \n- The net difference is a **refund of $49.92** (total).  \n\nSince your original payment was made via gift card, the refund will be credited back to your gift card immediately.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with:  \n1. The **20MP, 3x zoom, SD card** Digital Camera (item ID 8363011723)?  \n2. The **1L, glass, black** Electric Kettle (item ID 2323972008)?  \n3.
