Similarly, the mechanical keyboard with no backlight and 80% size (**1656367028_80_percent_no_backlight**) is also not currently in stock.  \n\nHere’s what I can do:  \n1. Check if there are alternative sizes or designs available for the skateboard (e.g., 32-inch or standard design).  \n2. Verify if a different keyboard option (e.g., 80% size with a different switch type) is available.  \n\nCould you please confirm if you'd like to:  \n- Swap the skateboard for a different size or design (e.g., 32-inch, standard design)?  \n- Swap the keyboard for a different option (e.g., 80% size with clicky switch, no backlight)?  \n\nLet me know so I can assist you with a feasible exchange! 😊", "score": 0.0, "stop_reason": "stop", "env_class": "tau_bench", "env_extras": {"data_source": "tau_bench", "reward_spec": "{\"method\": \"tau_bench_reward\", \"ground_truth\": [{\"name\": \"return_delivered_order_items\", \"kwargs\": {\"order_id\": \"#W4864669\", \"item_ids\": [\"5565631513\", \"9580569596\", \"9228757377\"], \"payment_method_id\": \"gift_card_9909795\"}}, {\"name\": \"exchange_delivered_order_items\", \"kwargs\": {\"order_id\": \"#W7293142\", \"item_ids\": [\"6956751343\", \"9025753381\"], \"new_item_ids\": [\"4293355847\", \"9665000388\"], \"payment_method_id\": \"gift_card_9909795\"}}]}", "extra_info": "{\"domain\": \"retail\", \"instruction\": \"Your name is Noah Sanchez and your email is noah.sanchez7461@example.com.
