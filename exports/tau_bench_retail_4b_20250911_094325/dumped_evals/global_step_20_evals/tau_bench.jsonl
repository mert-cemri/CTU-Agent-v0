The current laptop you're exchanging is priced at $2,520.52, and the new 13-inch model with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is priced at $2,621.77. This results in a difference of $101.25, which cannot be covered by your current gift card balance.  \n\nWould you like to:  \n1. Choose a different laptop model with a lower price difference?  \n2. Use a different payment method (e.g., credit card) to cover the difference?  \n3. Proceed with the exchange and pay the difference using another method?  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!\nuser\nI must have missed that; can I use another gift card to cover the difference?\nassistant\nI'd be happy to help you use another gift card to cover the price difference.

Maybe we can explore another option?\nassistant\nNo problem! Let's explore a more affordable 13-inch laptop option that fits within your budget.  \n\nHere’s a great alternative:  \n- **13-inch, i5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Space Grey** (Item ID: `6056040996`)  \n- Price: **$2,609.37**  \n- Price difference from your current laptop: $2,609.37 - $2,520.52 = **$88.85**  \n\nThis is still a small difference, and since your original payment was made with a gift card, we can use the same gift card to cover the $88.85 difference (assuming your balance is sufficient).  \n\nWould you like to proceed with this option instead? If yes, I’ll go ahead and process the exchange. Let me know!\nuser\nLet's go with that one.
