Unfortunately, the exact combination of **\"clicky switch, no backlight, 80%\"** is not available.

The 80% size is available, though the switch type differs.\n\n### Skateboard:\nYou want to exchange the current skateboard (bamboo, 34-inch, custom design) for one with a 31-inch deck and a plain design. The following option matches your request:\n- **Bamboo deck, 31-inch, plain design** (Item ID: `4293355847`, Price: $200.80)\n\nThis option is available and fits your specifications.\n\n### Next Steps:\nWould you like to proceed with one of the available keyboard options (either linear or clicky with no backlight and 80%) and the 31-inch plain bamboo skateboard? If so, please confirm which option you'd prefer, and I’ll process the exchange using your gift card (ID: `gift_card_9909795`). \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!\nuser\nLet's go with the clicky switch, no backlight, and 80% size keyboard option, and the 31-inch plain design skateboard.

I found the available options for the grill product type. A portable gas grill is available and matches your request. Here are the details:\n\n- **Type**: Gas  \n- **Size**: Portable  \n- **Features**: Side burner  \n- **Item ID**: 9724317332  \n- **Price**: $1042.19  \n\nThis is a suitable replacement for your original electric grill.  \n\nSince your original grill (electric, medium, side burner) was priced at $1058.86, the new gas portable grill is slightly cheaper at $1042.19, resulting in a refund of the price difference.  \n\nI'll proceed with modifying your order to include this gas portable grill. I'll also use your existing payment method (credit card ending in 3566337) for the refund.  \n\n{\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"modify_pending_order_items\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"#W3007862\\\", \\\"item_ids\\\": [\\\"5666020311\\\"], \\\"new_item_ids\\\": [\\\"9724317332\\\"], \\\"payment_method_id\\\": \\\"credit_card_3566337\\\"}\"}}]}", "score": 0.0, "stop_reason": "stop", "env_class": "tau_bench", "env_extras": {"data_source": "tau_bench", "reward_spec": "{\"method\": \"tau_bench_reward\", \"ground_truth\": [{\"name\": \"modify_pending_order_items\", \"kwargs\": {\"order_id\": \"#W3007862\", \"item_ids\": [\"5666020311\"], \"new_item_ids\": [\"9724317332\"], \"payment_method_id\": \"credit_card_3566337\"}}, {\"name\": \"cancel_pending_order\", \"kwargs\": {\"order_id\": \"#W1890669\", \"reason\": \"ordered by mistake\"}}]}", "extra_info": "{\"domain\": \"retail\", \"instruction\": \"Your name is Evelyn Lopez and your email is evelyn.lopez6910@example.com.
