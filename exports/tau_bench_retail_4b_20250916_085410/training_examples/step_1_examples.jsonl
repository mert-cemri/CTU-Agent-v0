Could you confirm that?\nassistant\nI apologize for the confusion earlier! Let me correct that and make sure we only change the color to brown while keeping the material and height unchanged.\n\nSince the original bookshelf was glass, white, and 5 ft tall, I'll locate the variant that matches those dimensions but with a brown color. Looking at the product details, there is a glass bookshelf with a brown color and 5 ft height (item ID: 4894369688), which is available.\n\nI'll now update your order to reflect this change — only changing the color to brown while maintaining glass material and 5 ft height. Here's what will be updated:\n\n- Bookshelf: Glass, Brown, 5 ft height, priced at $537.01  \n\nThis will result in a price increase due to the color change. I'll proceed with this adjustment. \n\nLet me confirm this change with you before finalizing it. Would you like to proceed with changing only the color to brown (glass, 5 ft height)?\nuser\nYes, that's correct.

It seems that the order status has changed and is no longer pending, which means we can't modify the items anymore. \n\nThe original order (#W6724985) has likely moved past the modification window, so any changes to the items—such as changing the color of the bookshelf—are no longer possible through this system. \n\nHowever, if you're still interested in having a brown bookshelf, you may want to consider placing a new order with the desired specifications.
