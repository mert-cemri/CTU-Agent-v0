You can choose any of these.*\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes:\n- The total amount of $3,227.98 will remain unchanged since the payment is tied to your gift card.  \n- Any price difference between the original and new items will be handled automatically (you'll receive a refund or credit if the new item is cheaper).  \n- All changes must be made to the same product type (camera and kettle).  \n\nPlease confirm which new item IDs you'd like for the digital camera and electric kettle, and I'll proceed with the update!\nuser\nFor the digital camera, I'd like to change it to a resolution of 20MP. And for the electric kettle, I'd like to switch the material to glass. Can we proceed with that?\nassistant\nGreat! Let's confirm the specific changes you'd like:\n\n- **Digital Camera**:  \n  - New resolution: 20MP  \n  - Zoom: 5x (from 3x)  \n  - Storage: CF card  \n  - Price: $3,280.31 (item ID: 9644439410)  \n\n- **Electric Kettle**:  \n  - New material: glass  \n  - Capacity: 1L  \n  - Color: silver (from black)  \n  - Price: $137.17 (item ID: 1240311797)  \n\n> ✅ Both changes are available and within the same product type.  \n> ⚠️ The total order value will increase due to the camera upgrade. Since your payment is tied to a gift card, the price difference will be covered by the gift card balance (no additional charge).  \n\nWould you like to proceed with these changes? Please confirm with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"\nuser\nActually, I just want the camera to have a 20MP resolution, without upgrading anything else. Can you help with that?\nassistant\nAbsolutely! Let's simplify the change to just the resolution:\n\n- **Digital Camera**:  \n  - New resolution: 20MP  \n  - Zoom: 3x (unchanged)  \n  - Storage: SD card (unchanged)  \n  - Price: $2,823.96 (item ID: 8363011723)  \n\n> ✅ This option is available and matches your request.  \n> ⚠️ The price is lower than the original ($2,875.61 → $2,823.96), so you'll receive a **refund of $51.65** to your gift card.  \n\n- **Electric Kettle**: No change (remains 1L, stainless steel, black at $153.25).  \n\nWould you like to proceed with this updated camera option only? Please confirm with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"\nuser\nYes, please proceed with the resolution change for the digital camera.
