After reviewing the available options, here’s what we found:\n\n### Available Cordless Vacuum Options:\n1. **Robotic, Bagged, Cordless**  \n   - Item ID: `4602305039`  \n   - Price: $561.05 (a savings of $59.02 compared to your original $620.07)  \n\n2. **Canister, Bagged, Cordless**  \n   - Item ID: `1345513440`  \n   - Price: $655.59 (an increase of $35.52)  \n\n3. **Robotic, Bagless, Cordless**  \n   - Item ID: `4806644905`  \n   - Price: $658.89 (an increase of $38.82)  \n\n⚠️ Unfortunately, the **robotic, bagless, cordless** option (`4806644905`) is available but priced higher than your original choice.\n\n### Recommendation:\nSince you specifically wanted the **cordless** feature and are open to a trade-off in price or type:\n- The **robotic, bagged, cordless** option (`4602305039`) is the most affordable and still maintains compatibility with your existing setup.\n- It saves you $59.02 and keeps the vacuum robotic (which you likely preferred).\n\nWould you like to proceed with changing the vacuum cleaner to:\n✅ Robotically operated  \n✅ Bagged  \n✅ With cordless functionality?  \n\nThis will reduce the total cost and keep everything aligned with your preferences.\n\nJust reply \"**yes**\" if you'd like me to make this change instead! 😊\nuser\nLet's go with the robotic, bagged, cordless option.
