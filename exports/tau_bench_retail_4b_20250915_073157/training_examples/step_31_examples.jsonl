What new cycling helmet would you like to exchange it for?  \n   (Please specify size, color, and ventilation level — e.g., size L, red, medium ventilation.)  \n2. Should we use your existing gift card (`gift_card_5437583`) for any price difference?  \n\nLet me know so I can finalize the exchange! 😊\nuser\nI haven't decided on the new helmet yet.

We can hold off on selecting a new helmet for now.  \n\nTo confirm:  \n- You’d like to **exchange** your current cycling helmet (size M, blue, high ventilation) from order **#W6818211**.  \n- The exchange will be processed once you select a new helmet.  \n- Any price difference will be handled using your gift card (`gift_card_5437583`).  \n\nWould you like me to:  \n1. Save this exchange request for later (so you can choose the new helmet anytime)?  \n2. Or proceed with a temporary \"exchange pending\" status until you decide?  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to move forward — I’m happy to wait until you’re ready! 🚴‍♂️\nuser\nLet's go with the \"exchange pending\" status until I decide. Sounds good?\nassistant\nGreat choice, Liam! I’ve set up your exchange request with a **\"pending\" status** for now.  \n\n✅ Your cycling helmet (size M, blue, high ventilation) from order **#W6818211** is flagged for exchange.  \n📌 You can update the new helmet details at any time — just reach out!  \n\nIf you decide on a new helmet later, just let me know with:  \n- The size, color, and ventilation preference.  \n- Whether you'd like to keep using your gift card for price differences.  \n\nI’ll be here to help whenever you’re ready.

Based on your request, here's the available option for the espresso machine that matches your specifications:\n\n- **Pressure**: 9 bar  \n- **Capacity**: 1.5L  \n- **Type**: Capsule  \n\n✅ Available Item:  \n- **Item ID**: `3815173328`  \n- **Price**: $2908.42  \n\nThis is higher than your current espresso machine ($2709.83), so there will be a price difference of **$198.59**, which will be covered using your existing gift card (ending in 3377580).  \n\n### Next Steps:\nWould you like to proceed with replacing the current espresso machine (Item ID: 3714494375) with this new one (Item ID: 3815173328)?  \nPlease confirm with a \"yes\" or \"no.\"  \n\n> Note: This change can only be made once for a pending order. Once confirmed, the update will be applied, and you’ll receive a confirmation email.\nuser\nYes, go ahead and make that change. Also, for the tea kettle, I want to modify the material to glass, increase the capacity to 2 liters, and make it electric stovetop compatible.
