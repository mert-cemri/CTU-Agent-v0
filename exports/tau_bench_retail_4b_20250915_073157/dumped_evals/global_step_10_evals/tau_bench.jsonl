Here's what I can share to help:\n\n- **Pending orders**: Modifications (like changing items, size, or materials) can be made directly.  \n- **Delivered orders**: Changes are only possible through an exchange (one-time) or a return.  \n\nSince you mentioned wanting to make changes to the grill (to be portable) and running shoes (to different sizes and materials), these modifications would likely require the order to be pending or eligible for exchange.\n\nI recommend checking your email or order receipts for the order ID. If you can't find it, I can help you look up your account details or assist with finding your recent orders if you provide your email or other identifying information.\n\nWould you like to share your email address or any other details so I can help locate your order history?\nuser\nI appreciate your help, but let me double-check on my end and see if I can find any details myself.

Each item in the order must have a valid configuration (such as size, skin tone, and brand) or be fully removed.  \n\nIf you'd like, I can help you **remove the Makeup Kit entirely** from the order — but this would require replacing it with another item of the same product type, or canceling the order if no replacement is desired.  \n\nWould you like to:  \n1. Replace the Makeup Kit with a different option (e.g., a different size or skin tone)?  \n2. Remove the Makeup Kit and cancel the order?  \n\nLet me know your preference, and I’ll assist accordingly! 😊\nuser\nIn that case, could we cancel another order I made by mistake?
