It seems that removing an item requires a different approach — we cannot remove an item by simply setting the new item IDs to an empty array.

Removing an item from a pending order requires a specific action, and it seems the system does not allow removal by simply updating item IDs.  \n\nTo properly remove the item, we would need to use a different process — such as a cancellation or deletion request — which may not be available in the current tools.  \n\nWould you like me to:  \n1. Cancel the entire order instead?  \n2. Try another method to remove the item?  \n3.
