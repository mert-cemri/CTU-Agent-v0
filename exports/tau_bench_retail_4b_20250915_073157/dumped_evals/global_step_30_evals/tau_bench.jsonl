Unfortunately, I don't have the order ID with me right now.\nassistant\nIt looks like there's a bit of confusion—item IDs and gift card IDs are different. The item ID refers to the product you're returning, while the gift card ID is related to payment. Could you please confirm if you meant to provide the item ID for the indoor security camera (e.g., 1008292230) or if you're referring to a different type of ID? \n\nIf you're unsure, I can help you locate the order with the camera by checking your account details.

Is it possible to help me using just that?\nassistant\nNo, the gift card ID (like `gift_card_2519457`) cannot be used to locate the order or return an item. The gift card is used for payment, not for identifying products or orders. \n\nTo return the indoor security camera, I'll need the **order ID** (e.g., #W0000000) or the **item ID** of the camera (e.g., 1008292230). \n\nCould you please provide either:\n- The order ID, or  \n- The item ID of the indoor security camera?\n\nOnce I have that, I can assist you with the return process.\nuser\nI can provide the return authorization number for the procedure.
