If so, please let me know which one you'd prefer!  \n\nAlternatively, if you'd like to keep the current customization, I can confirm that as is. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 😊\nuser\nI appreciate the options, but I'd like the Makeup Kit removed from the order entirely.

All available variants require at least one of these options. Removing the item would require replacing it with another product or a different variant, but there is no \"default\" or \"uncustomized\" version available.  \n\nIf you'd like, I can help you:  \n- Replace the Makeup Kit with a different variant (e.g., light skin tone, basic size, or a different brand), or  \n- Remove the item and place a new order with a different product.  \n\nWould you like to proceed with one of these options?
