For tool usage:\\n   Output ONLY a valid JSON object with this EXACT structure:\\n   {\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"tool_name\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\\\"param\\\\\": \\\\\"value\\\\\"}\"}}]}\\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n- The \"arguments\" field must be a JSON string (not a JSON object)\\n- Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON when using tools\\n- Do NOT use markdown code blocks\\n- Do NOT include <|im_end|> or any other tokens\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF CORRECT USAGE:\\n\\nExample 1 - Finding a user by name and zip:\\nUser: My name is Yusuf Rossi and my zip is 19122. I need help with my order.\\nAssistant: {\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"find_user_id_by_name_zip\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\\\"first_name\\\\\": \\\\\"Yusuf\\\\\", \\\\\"last_name\\\\\": \\\\\"Rossi\\\\\", \\\\\"zip\\\\\": \\\\\"19122\\\\\"}\"}}]}\\n\\nExample 2 - Getting user details:\\nUser: [Previous tool returned user_id: yusuf_rossi_9620]\\nAssistant: {\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_user_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\\\"user_id\\\\\": \\\\\"yusuf_rossi_9620\\\\\"}\"}}]}\\n\\nExample 3 - Getting order details:\\nUser: [User has order #W4776164]\\nAssistant: {\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"get_order_details\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\\\"order_id\\\\\": \\\\\"#W4776164\\\\\"}\"}}]}\\n\\nExample 4 - Regular conversation (no tool):\\nUser: Thank you for your help!\\nAssistant: You\\'re welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\n\\nExample 5 - Canceling an order:\\nUser: I want to cancel order #W2989580\\nAssistant: {\"tool_calls\": [{\"function\": {\"name\": \"cancel_pending_order\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\\\"order_id\\\\\": \\\\\"#W2989580\\\\\"}\"}}]}\\n\\nRemember: When you need to use a tool, output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else!\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nHello!
